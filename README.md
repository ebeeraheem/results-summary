## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

- **Note**: Although there is a JSON file included, I did not use it to populate the data dynamically as I still haven't learned JavaScript as at the time of deploying this (3:33 PM; 7th Oct, 2023)

### Screenshot

A screenshot of the site to give you a quick view of the site on both the desktop and mobile view.
Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This is my first attempt at both mobile-first and responsive design. It is honestly easier than I thought it would be. I'm sure I'm saying this only because I haven't been into it for a long time, but still, it was pretty easy. It took two days to complete though lol.

### Continued development

I would love to dive deeper into flex and grid layouts. I believe they're very powerful tools that would aid in my becoming a better web developer.

### Useful resources

For this project, like usual, I googled a ton of things, even basic things that I honestly should've know by heart at this point. I also used the free version of OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google Bard.

Can't forget the MDN Web Docs now can I. Best guide I've received so far in my journey.
